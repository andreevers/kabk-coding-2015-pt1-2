## what have we learnt?
- we got processing to run and wrote our first processing sketch.
- by leaving [comments](http://processing.org/examples/statementscomments.html) with explanations throughout the program, we can make sure we still know what the code does, the next time we (or someone else) look at it.
- we draw some basic shapes, like rectangles([`rect()`](http://processing.org/reference/rect_.html)), ellipses / circles([`ellipse()`](http://processing.org/reference/ellipse_.html)), triangles([`triangle()`](http://processing.org/reference/triangle_.html)), and lines([`line()`](http://processing.org/reference/line_.html)).
- [`background()`](http://processing.org/reference/background_.html) sets the background color of the canvas.
- using [`fill()`](http://processing.org/reference/fill_.html) and [`stroke()`](http://processing.org/reference/stroke_.html) we specify the fill color and outline color of all the shapes we draw next (until we change them to something else).
- with [`strokeWeight()`](http://processing.org/reference/strokeWeight_.html) we set the weight of the outline.
- [`noFill`](http://processing.org/reference/noFill_.html) and [`noStroke()`](http://processing.org/reference/noStroke_.html) disable filling / stroking.
- processing's [coordinate system](http://processing.org/examples/coordinates.html) has its origin (0, 0) in the upper left corner (just like photoshop).
- all of processing's functions and variables are listed and explained in [the reference](http://processing.org/reference/).


## additional explanations
- more on [shapes and coordinates](http://processing.org/tutorials/drawing/)


## homework
- To familiarize yourself some more with what's possible with *creative coding,* take some time to browse through [creative applications](http://www.creativeapplications.net/) and look at the projects.
- In a couple of days: look at today's code again
	- see if you still understand it
	- if not: use the [online reference](http://processing.org/reference) (or other sources)
- Choose a cartoon character you like and draw it in processing. Use the shapes we've used in class, but also have a look at [the reference](http://processing.org/reference/) for things we may not have talked about â€” check out the items under the following sections: __2D Primitives__, __Curves__
- Make an account for [are.na](https://www.are.na/)
	- post your cartoon character to the [course channel](https://www.are.na/share/UvHpIRl)
